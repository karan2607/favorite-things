My name is Karan Pandya and I graduated from University of Texas at Arlington on May 11,2019. I studied M.S. in Computer Science 
and my GPA is 3.5. I am currently seeking job opportunities as a software developer so that I can enhance my knowledge in this 
field and get some good experience along the way.
